### Six steps from "never heard of it" to "this is my thing"

* **Awareness**: I've heard of this. 
* **Understanding**:  I understand what this is,and what it might be like for me to be involved.
* **Identification**: I can imagine myself doing this. 
* **Access**: I can physically, logistically, and financially do this. 
* **Belonging**: I feel like I fit in here.
* **Ownership**: I care enough to take responsibility for this.

# How this concepts are useful for my package ?

## Convey

* Create a comprehensive [README](https://blog.r-hub.io/2019/12/03/readmes/): clearly explains what your package does, how to install it, and how users can start using it. Include examples or use cases and (links to) any relevant information which might help users understand how your package can help them.

* [Pin your package repository to your profile](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/pinning-items-to-your-profile) so other people can find it quickly.

* [Create a universe on R-universe](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/06/22/setup-runiverse/), simplify the installation of your package, and provide useful stats and information about it.

## Convey

* We recommend creating a **documentation website** for your package using pkgdown. 

* Leverage platforms like Mastodon, LinkedIn, and R-specific forums such as [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) and [R Weekly](https://rweekly.org/) to announce the release of your package.

* If you like to give talks, you can speak at an R User Group or [R-Ladies Chapter](https://www.meetup.com/pro/rladies/).

* Presenting your package at a **domain-specific conference** or at R-specific conferences.

* If your package fits in a [CRAN Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) you can propose the addition.

## Contribute

Make your repo contribution and collaboration friendly

* Code of conduct (`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`): you can insert one with `use_code_of_conduct()` from the `usethis` package. The template comes from https://www.contributor-covenant.org.

* OSI License (`LICENSE.md`).

* Contributing guide (`CONTRIBUTING.md`): an easy way to insert a template for a contributing guide is the `use_tidy_contributing()` from the `usethis` package.

## Contributing guide

Personal preferences in a contributing guide include:

* Style preferences? 

* Infrastructure like roxygen2?

* Workflow preferences? Issue before a PR?

* Describe how you acknowledge contributions. 

* A scope statement, like in the [skimr](https://github.com/ropensci/skimr/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#understanding-the-scope-of-skimr) package?

* We encourages contributing guides to include a [lifecycle statement clarifying visions and expectations](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/fasterize/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#roadmap) for the future development of your package.
